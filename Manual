1. Introduction
    GTFmerge is a C++ script written by Matthew Patrick at the University of Michigan Dermatology Department designed to produce a singular genomic annnotation containing all non-overlapping information from several input files. Gtfmergetool takes input files in Gene Transfer Format (GTF).
    The tool is designed to exclude all exons of a particular gene in which at least one exon of the gene overlaps with any exon within any input GTF file. One input file is designated as the Reference GTF (--refGTF) which serves as the base of the merged output. In the situation in which exons of genes
    from one input GTF overlap with an exon of another input, information from the designated reference will be preserved while the gene from the other GTF (which is designated as a "Target GTF") will be discarded.
